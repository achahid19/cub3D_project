## Introduction

The **cub3d** project aims to develop a 3D game using the **raycasting** technique, the same method made famous by *Wolfenstein 3D*. This group project was a collaborative effort, and I was fortunate to work alongside [@Khdzakariae](https://github.com/Khdzakariae/).

## Map Parsing

The **cub3D** executable accepts a single argument: a `.cub` map file. This file must adhere to the following structure:

- **Header Lines:**  
  Specify textures with `NO`, `SO`, `EA`, and `WE`, followed by valid `.xpm` paths. Define floor (`F`) and ceiling (`C`) colors in RGB format separated by commas.

- **Map Body:**  
  Acceptable characters include:
  - `1`: Wall
  - `0`: Floor
  - `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`: Player starting positions  
  The map must be enclosed by walls, with spaces allowed but non-walkable.

**Example Map:**
```plaintext
NO textures/wall_1.xpm
SO textures/wall_2.xpm
WE textures/wall_3.xpm
EA textures/wall.xpm

F 184,113,39
C 51,198,227

## Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. 
The logic behind RayCasting is to throw rays in the direction of the player view. Basically, we need to check the distance between the player and the nearest wall (i.e. the point where the ray hits a wall) to caculate the height of the vertical lines we draw. Here is a simple depiction of it:

</div>

### Walls
    
To calculate the **distance between the player and the nearest wall**, we can use the following algorithm:

**1.** Define and initialize some basic attributes needed for the projection: 

<table align="center">
    <tr aling="center">
        <th> Attribute </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Value </th>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> FOV </td>
        <td> The field of view of the player
            <div align="center">
    <img width="150" align="center" alt="FOV Image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71781441/154864710-baee6726-6f2a-4f37-8125-97a5cf52c4f7.png">
</div>
        <td> 60º </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> HFOV </td>
        <td> Half of the player's FOV </td>
        <td> 30º </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> Ray angle </td>
        <td> Angle of the player view's direction </td>
        <td> N (270º), S (90º), W (180º), E (0º) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> Ray increment angle </td>
        <td> Angle difference between one ray and the next one </td>
        <td> <code>2 * HFOV / window_width</code> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> Precision </td>
        <td> Size of 'steps' taken every iteration </td>
        <td> 50 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> Limit </td>
        <td> Limit of the distance the player can view </td>
        <td> 11 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td> Player's position </td>
        <td> Center of the square where the player is </td>
        <td> <code>(int)(player_x + 0.5), (int)(player_y + 0.5)</code> </td>
    </tr>
</table>


**2.** From the the player's position, we move the ray forward incrementing the x's and y's coordinates of the ray.

```c
ray.x += ray_cos;
ray.y += ray_sin;
```

where `ray_cos` and `ray_sin` are the following:
```c
ray_cos = cos(degree_to_radians(ray_angle)) / g->ray.precision;
ray_sin = sin(degree_to_radians(ray_angle)) / g->ray.precision;
```

**3.** Repeat step **2** until we reach the limit or we hit a wall.

**4.** Calculate the distance between the player's and the ray's position using the euclidean distance:
```c
distance = sqrt(powf(x - pl.x - 0.5, 2.) + powf(y - pl.y - 0.5, 2.));
```

**5.** Fix fisheye
```c
distance = distance * cos(degree_to_radians(ray_angle - g->ray.angle))
```

This algorith is repeated ``window_width`` times, i.e. in every iteration we increment the angle until we have been through all the field of view. 
This distance is really helpful to calculate the height of the wall height:
```c
wall_height = (window_height / (1.5 * distance));
```

### Textures

Once we have hit a wall and know its position and distance to the player, we must check which side was hit and choose the correct texture for that side of the wall. With the correct texture file and the proper height of the wall at hand it we can read pixels from the texture file at a given width and copy them to the screen, following this formula:

```c
/* Get the color from image i at the given x and y pixel */
color = my_mlx_pixel_get(i, (int)(i->width * (g->x + g->y)) % i->width, z);
```

Note: in some cases the sprite's height is smaller than the height of the sprite we have to draw. We have an algorithm that effectively 'stretches' the sprite to fit the proper height

## Controls

Here is a summary of the various controls in the game:

- The ``WASD`` keys move the player up, down, left and right relative to the player's viewing angle
- The ``left`` and ``right`` arrow keys rotate the viewing angle of the player
- Press the ``ESC`` key or the ``X`` button on the window to exit the game

Note: these are the basic mandatory controls, but we added a few more keys to handle other things. See below for such controls

## Bonus

For this project there were several bonuses, and we did 3 of them:

* Wall Collisions (DONE)

When walking to a wall, instead of stopping in front of it we split the movement into the ``x`` and ``y`` vectors and try to move in either of them, making wall collisions possible

* Minimap

* Doors

* Animations (DONE)

* Rotation with mouse (Press 1 key for activation) (DONE)

This one was very straightforward. There is an event on the ``minilibX`` library that tells the user the position of the mouse. When the position changes, we increment/decrement the player's view direction accordingly

## Extras

We implemented a few things that we were not asked to implement, but we thought would give the project a cooler vibe:

- Added darkening effect to the game. The farther a wall is hit, the darker it is drawn. This gives the game a cave-like feel
- Game works both in Linux and MacOS
- A music running in the background (famous and well known smati hicham instrument remix).
